    Why do I choose the department <br>
    of English?<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    It is because......
<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        Personally, I chose the English Department <br>
        because I like to read and analyze texts. <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        I also see the potential in literature as a conduit to social and political criticism <br>
        and thus to social and political change. 
        <br>
        <li>
        Literature is a powerful voice of an individual as well as a culture and a people. 
    </li>
        
        <li>   
        It posits possibilities and frames questions for the world.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are so many perspectives in literary criticism that each word has dozens of meanings.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>      
        There is also the joy and pleasure of literature for literature’s sake,<br>
    </li>
    <li>  
        but I never found any satisfaction in teaching it that way.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>  
        I’ve been to places I never would have been to, I’ve lived in the past and the future and I’ve influenced the present.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>  
        knowing how to read, write, analyze, and communicate are the best foundations for a hosts of careers,too!

Barisal, officially called Barishal, city, south-central Bangladesh. <br>
It lies in the delta of the Padma (Ganges [Ganga]) and Jamuna (Brahmaputra) rivers on the Kirtonkhola,<br>
An offshoot of the Arial Khan River. <br>
Incorporated as a municipality in 1876, it is a trade centre, <br>
most notably for rice, jute, and fish. It is linked by ship with Dhaka, <br>
about 73 miles (117 km) to the north, Chittagong, to the southeast, and Khulna, to the southwest. <br>

thundering noises heard in the delta and apparently coming from the sea. The sounds have not been satisfactorily explained.<br>
